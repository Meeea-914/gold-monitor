A monitoring tool to collect all important metrics from your [Gold](https://github.com/goldcoin-gl/gold-blockchain) farming node and connected harvesters.

These metrics are collected from the Gold daemon via RPC and WebSocket interfaces and can also be used to send you push notifications with regular status updates, alert you if something goes wrong, a proof is found, or you receive payments to your farmer wallet.

All metrics are exported to a [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) compatible `/metrics` endpoint and a [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) dashboard is also provided:

![grafana](.readme/grafana.png)

This example dashboard displays almost all collected metrics and can be imported from [grafana.com](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14544) using the ID `14544` or using the `grafana/dashboard.json` from this repository.

## How to Support

If you find this tool helpful and want to support the development, feel free to give this repo a ⭐ or donate some Gold (GL) to my address: `gl1w9clzakz3rmyw7d2q7j233uy8afp8ymeqmpjs5wa8s5j3a4cla5sycrlmq`

## Notifications

To use notifications, please configure a `status_service_url` and `alert_service_url` for your desired notification service in the `config.json`. You can use most popular notifications services by creating a service specific webhook URL, following the instructions from [this](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki) wiki. If you wish to disable notifications entirely, you can set the `enable` flag in the `notifications` section of the `config.json` to `false`.

Following notifications are currently sent to the `status_service_url`:

### Farm summary (configurable interval in `config.json`)

```md
** 👨‍🌾 Farm Status 👩‍🌾 **
🌾 OG Plot Count: 3797
🌾 Portable Plot Count: 50
🧺 OG Plot Size: 375.828 TiB
🧺 Portable Plot Size: 4.948 TiB
🚜 Plot Change 24h: +86 (+8.511 TiB)
⌛️ Signage Points Per Minute: 6.30
🔎 Passed Filters Per Minute: 49.30
✅ Total Proofs found: 73
💰 Total Balance: 2.00001 GL
🕰️ Time To Win: 2 weeks and 4 days
💾 Current Netspace: 30.706 EiB
🏔️ Peak Height: 544594
🧮 Mempool Size: 15
📶 Full Node Peer Count: 8
🔄 Synced: True
```

### Proof found alert

Triggers when a new partial or full proof is found. To limit the amount of notifications when pooling, this can be disabled in the config using the `disable_proof_found_alert` setting.

```md
** 🤑 Proof found! 🤑 **
Your farm found a new partial or full proof
```

---
Following notifications are currently sent to the `alert_service_url`:

### Sync lost alert

```md
** 🚨 Farmer Lost Sync! 🚨 **
It seems like your farmer lost its connection to the Gold Network
```

### Sync recovery alert

```md
** ✅ Farmer Synced! ✅ **
Your farmer is successfully synced to the Gold Network again
```

### Plots lost alert

Triggers when the total plot count of your farm drops below a configurable threshold (default: 1).

The corresponding `lost_plots_alert_threshold` parameter can be adjusted in the `config.json`.

```md
** 🚨 Farmer Lost Plots! 🚨 **
It seems like your farmer lost some plots
Expected: 130, Found: 124
```

### Plots recovery alert

```md
** ✅ Farmer Plots recoverd! ✅ **
Your farmer's plot count has recovered to its previous value
```

### Payment alert

```md
** 🤑 Payment received! 🤑 **
Your wallet received a new payment
🌱 +0.10240 GL
```
